My Java notes jotted down from some of the best books in Java (OCJP Java, Thinking in Java, Effective Java, Java Puzzlers and of course JLS) and published as a blog with the help of the awesome Github's Jekyll.

It attempts to demystify some of the most misunderstood concepts in Java which may confound even many experienced java programmers.

This blog may not be the best for greenhorns(new learners) but may be worth a read for others, who can contribute too by simply sending in a pull request.

After completing this, if you want to get your hands dirty then do try to solve some problems involving various algorithms and data structures in Java.
